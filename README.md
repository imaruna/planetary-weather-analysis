# Planetary Weather Data Analysis (NASA)
Analyzed planetary weather data using Pandas and Plotly to identify seasonal trends and estimate the length of a year on an unknown planet.

## Overview
This project explores time-series atmospheric data to detect seasonal patterns and infer the planet’s orbital period (year length). I cleaned and aggregated daily readings, visualized temperature/pressure trends, and compared month-like groupings to find repeating cycles.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and type parsing (dates, missing values)
- Aggregation to monthly/seasonal windows
- Time-series visualization and rolling means
- Cycle-length estimation from repeating peaks/troughs

## Tools & Skills
Python | Pandas | Plotly | Time-Series Analysis | Data Cleaning

## Results
- Identified clear seasonal patterns in temperature and pressure data
- Estimated the planet’s year length to be approximately **687 Earth days**, based on repeating seasonal cycles
- Findings suggest a climate and orbital period consistent with Mars-like planetary characteristics

## Data
Public educational dataset used in coursework (NASA-style planetary weather).  
Dataset not included due to size/source constraints.
